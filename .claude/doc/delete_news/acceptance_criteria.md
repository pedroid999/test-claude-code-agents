## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Rapid Successive Deletes
**Scenario**: User clicks individual delete buttons rapidly
**Expected Behavior**:
- Only one delete operation processes at a time
- Subsequent clicks are ignored/queued
- No duplicate delete API calls
- Loading state prevents multiple clicks
- All operations complete successfully or fail gracefully

### Edge Case 2: Delete During Loading
**Scenario**: User attempts to delete while other operations are loading
**Expected Behavior**:
- Delete operations are disabled during loading
- Visual indication of disabled state
- User must wait for current operation to complete
- No race conditions or state corruption

### Edge Case 3: Network Interruption During Bulk Delete
**Scenario**: Network disconnects during bulk delete operation
**Expected Behavior**:
- Operation fails gracefully
- Error message displayed
- UI shows previous state (no partial updates)
- User can retry when connection restored
- No data corruption

### Edge Case 4: Empty News Collection
**Scenario**: User has zero news items
**Expected Behavior**:
- Individual delete buttons not visible (no items)
- "Delete All" button disabled
- Empty state UI displayed
- No API calls made when clicking disabled button

### Edge Case 5: Session Expiration During Delete
**Scenario**: User's session expires while performing delete
**Expected Behavior**:
- 401 Unauthorized error caught
- User redirected to login
- No destructive action occurs
- Clear message about session expiration

### Edge Case 6: Very Large Dataset
**Scenario**: User has 1000+ news items and clicks "Delete All"
**Expected Behavior**:
- Single efficient API call
- Progress indication if needed
- Operation completes within reasonable time (< 10 seconds)
- No browser freezing or blocking
- Success message shows accurate count

### Edge Case 7: Concurrent Deletes (Multiple Tabs)
**Scenario**: User opens multiple tabs and deletes from both
**Expected Behavior**:
- Each delete operation validates independently
- 404 errors handled gracefully if item already deleted
- React Query cache syncs across tabs (if implemented)
- No duplicate delete attempts
- Consistent UI state across tabs
