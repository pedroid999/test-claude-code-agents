# Delete News Feature - Context Session

## Feature Overview
Implement a comprehensive delete functionality for news items, allowing users to:
1. Delete individual news items via a trash button on each news card
2. Delete all news items via a general "Delete All" button with a confirmation modal

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Backend Structure (Hexagonal Architecture)
- **Domain Layer**: `NewsItem` entity in `backend/src/domain/entities/news_item.py`
- **Repository Port**: `NewsRepository` interface in `backend/src/application/ports/news_repository.py`
  - Already has `delete(news_id: str) -> bool` method
- **Web Layer**: News router in `backend/src/infrastructure/web/routers/news.py`
  - Current endpoints: create, get user news, get public news, update status, toggle favorite, get stats
  - Missing: DELETE endpoint for individual items and bulk delete

### Frontend Structure (Feature-based Architecture)
- **Location**: `frontend/src/features/news/`
- **Service**: `news.service.ts` - API communication layer
  - Missing: delete and deleteAll methods
- **Components**:
  - `NewsCard.tsx` - Individual news card (needs trash button)
  - `NewsBoard.tsx` - Main board view (needs "Delete All" button)
  - Other views: `NewsMobileView.tsx`, `NewsColumn.tsx`

### Existing Use Cases
The project follows use case pattern:
- `CreateNewsUseCase`
- `GetPublicNewsUseCase`
- `GetUserNewsUseCase`
- `ToggleFavoriteUseCase`
- `UpdateNewsStatusUseCase`

Need to create:
- `DeleteNewsUseCase` - For individual deletion with authorization
- `DeleteAllUserNewsUseCase` - For bulk deletion with user verification

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Implementation

#### 1.1 Use Cases Layer
Create two new use cases in `backend/src/application/use_cases/news/`:

**DeleteNewsUseCase**
- Input: `news_id: str`, `user_id: str`
- Process:
  1. Verify news exists
  2. Verify user owns the news item
  3. Call repository delete method
- Output: `bool` (success)
- Exceptions: `NewsNotFoundException`, `UnauthorizedNewsAccessException`

**DeleteAllUserNewsUseCase**
- Input: `user_id: str`
- Process:
  1. Get all news for user
  2. Delete each item (or implement bulk delete in repository)
- Output: `int` (count of deleted items)
- Considerations: May need to add `delete_all_by_user_id` to repository port

#### 1.2 Repository Layer
Check if MongoDB adapter needs a bulk delete method:
- Add `delete_all_by_user_id(user_id: str) -> int` to `NewsRepository` port
- Implement in MongoDB adapter

#### 1.3 Web Layer
Add endpoints to `backend/src/infrastructure/web/routers/news.py`:

**DELETE /api/news/{news_id}**
- Auth: Required (current user)
- Response: 204 No Content on success
- Error codes: 404 (not found), 403 (unauthorized)

**DELETE /api/news/user/all**
- Auth: Required (current user)
- Response: `DeleteAllResponseDTO` with count
- Safety: Requires confirmation in frontend

### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation

#### 2.1 Service Layer
Add to `frontend/src/features/news/data/news.service.ts`:
```typescript
async deleteNews(newsId: string): Promise<void>
async deleteAllUserNews(): Promise<{ deleted_count: number }>
```

#### 2.2 Schema Updates
Add to `news.schema.ts`:
```typescript
export interface DeleteAllResponse {
  deleted_count: number;
}
```

#### 2.3 Mutations (React Query)
Create hooks in `frontend/src/features/news/hooks/mutations/`:

**useDeleteNews.ts**
- Call `newsService.deleteNews()`
- Invalidate queries on success
- Show success/error toast

**useDeleteAllNews.ts**
- Call `newsService.deleteAllUserNews()`
- Invalidate all news queries
- Show success message with count

#### 2.4 UI Components

**NewsCard Component** (`NewsCard.tsx`)
- Add trash icon button (from Radix UI or Lucide)
- Position: Top-right corner or in actions area
- Confirmation: Optional inline or via mutation callback
- Loading state during deletion

**NewsBoard Component** (`NewsBoard.tsx`)
- Add "Delete All News" button
- Position: Near filters or stats area
- Modal confirmation required

**Delete Confirmation Modal**
- Component: Create `DeleteAllConfirmModal.tsx`
- Message: "Are you sure you want to delete all news items? This action cannot be undone."
- Clear consequences:
  - Total count of items to be deleted
  - All statuses (pending, reading, read)
  - All favorites will be lost
- Buttons: "Cancel" (secondary) and "Delete All" (destructive/red)

### Phase 3: Testing

#### Backend Tests
- Unit tests for use cases (authorization, validation)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Repository tests for delete operations

#### Frontend Tests
- Mutation hook tests
- Component tests for trash button
- Modal interaction tests
- Service layer tests

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Authorization: Verify user owns news before deletion
- Rate limiting: Consider adding for bulk operations
- Soft delete vs Hard delete: Currently implementing hard delete

### UX Considerations
- Loading states during deletion
- Optimistic updates (remove from UI before API confirmation)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Undo functionality (future enhancement)
- Confirmation for single delete (optional based on UX preference)

### Performance
- Bulk delete should be efficient (single DB query)
- UI should update smoothly (React Query cache invalidation)
- Consider pagination impact when items are deleted

## Dependencies
- Backend: FastAPI, Motor (MongoDB)
- Frontend: React Query, Radix UI, Lucide React (icons)
- No new packages required

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can delete individual news items via trash button
2. Trash button appears on each news card
3. Individual deletion requires user ownership verification
4. Users can delete all their news via "Delete All" button
5. "Delete All" shows confirmation modal with clear consequences
6. Modal displays total count of items to be deleted
7. Successful deletion updates the UI immediately
8. Error states are handled gracefully
9. Both operations invalidate React Query cache
10. Backend validates user authorization for all deletions

## Backend Architecture Review (Completed)

### Expert Consultation - Backend Developer Agent

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Architecture approved with detailed implementation plan

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Repository Layer Enhancement
**Decision**: Add `delete_all_by_user_id(user_id: str) -> int` to repository port
**Rationale**:
- MongoDB's `delete_many()` provides atomic bulk deletion in single query
- Much more efficient than iterating through items (N queries vs 1 query)
- Returns count for user feedback
- Follows repository pattern of abstracting data layer

#### 2. Use Case Design
**Decision**: Two separate use cases with distinct responsibilities

**DeleteNewsUseCase**:
- Authorization-first approach: Get item -> Verify ownership -> Delete
- Raises domain exceptions for proper HTTP mapping
- Returns `bool` for simple success/failure
- Security: Two-step verification (existence + ownership)

**DeleteAllUserNewsUseCase**:
- Simplified logic: No authorization check needed (user's own items)
- Single repository call for efficiency
- Returns `int` count for user feedback
- Idempotent: Safe to call multiple times

#### 3. HTTP Status Codes
**Decision**: Follow REST conventions
- Individual delete: **204 No Content** (no response body)
- Bulk delete: **200 OK** with `DeleteAllNewsResponseDTO` (has response body)
- Error codes: 404 (not found), 403 (forbidden), 401 (not authenticated)

#### 4. Route Ordering - CRITICAL
**Decision**: Specific routes MUST come before parameterized routes
```python
@router.delete("/user/all", ...)  # MUST be first
@router.delete("/{news_id}", ...)  # Generic path after
```
**Rationale**: FastAPI matches routes in order. If reversed, "/user/all" would match "/{news_id}" with news_id="all"

#### 5. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Reuse existing domain exceptions
- `NewsNotFoundException` -> 404 NOT FOUND
- `UnauthorizedNewsAccessException` -> 403 FORBIDDEN
- No new exceptions needed

#### 6. Hard Delete vs Soft Delete
**Decision**: Implement hard delete (immediate removal)
**Rationale**: Simpler implementation, matches current codebase patterns
**Future Enhancement**: Consider soft delete with audit trail for compliance

### Performance Optimizations

1. **MongoDB Indexing**: Existing `user_id` index optimizes bulk delete
2. **Atomic Operations**: `delete_many()` is atomic at database level
3. **Query Efficiency**:
   - Individual delete: 2 queries (find_one + delete_one)
   - Bulk delete: 1 query (delete_many)

### Security Model

1. **Individual Delete**:
   - User MUST own the news item
   - Public news still requires ownership to delete
   - Two-step verification prevents unauthorized access

2. **Bulk Delete**:
   - MongoDB query includes user_id filter
   - No risk of deleting other users' items
   - Recommendation: Add rate limiting (max 5/hour)

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests** (3 files):
- `test_delete_news_use_case.py`: 4 test cases
- `test_delete_all_user_news_use_case.py`: 3 test cases
- Repository tests: 5 test cases

**Integration Tests**:
- 7 API endpoint tests covering all scenarios

### Important Implementation Notes

1. **Dependency Injection**: Follow established pattern (no @lru_cache on factory functions)
2. **Import Updates**: Update `__init__.py` in use_cases/news/
3. **DTO Creation**: `DeleteAllNewsResponseDTO` with count and message
4. **Authorization Location**: Use cases handle auth, not routers (hexagonal principle)
5. **No Breaking Changes**: Purely additive, fully backward compatible

## Frontend Architecture Review (Completed)

### Expert Consultation - Frontend Developer Agent

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Architecture approved with detailed implementation plan

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Service Layer Implementation
**Decision**: Add two methods to `newsService` object
- `deleteNews(newsId: string): Promise<void>` - Returns void for 204 response
- `deleteAllUserNews(): Promise<DeleteAllNewsResponse>` - Returns typed response with count

**Rationale**:
- Leverage existing `apiClient.delete` method (already handles errors, auth, 401 redirects)
- Type safety with explicit return types
- No duplication of error handling logic

#### 2. React Query Mutation Design
**Decision**: Create two separate mutation hooks following project patterns

**useDeleteNewsMutation**:
- Standard return: `{deleteNews, isLoading, error, isSuccess}`
- Broad cache invalidation: `queryKey: ['news']`
- Toast feedback on success/error
- No optimistic updates (ensures consistency)

**useDeleteAllNewsMutation**:
- Standard return: `{deleteAllNews, isLoading, error, isSuccess}`
- Same cache invalidation strategy
- Success toast shows deleted count
- No optimistic updates (too complex with stats)

**Rationale**:
- React Query v5 compatibility (`isPending` mapped to `isLoading`)
- Consistency with existing mutations (toggle favorite, update status)
- Broad invalidation simpler than manual cache updates

#### 3. Context Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Add delete operations to `NewsContextType`

**New Context Properties**:
```typescript
interface NewsContextType {
  // Delete operations
  deleteNews: (newsId: string) => void;
  deleteAllNews: () => void;

  // Aggregated state
  deleteState: {
    isLoading: boolean;
    error: Error | null;
  };
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Centralizes all news operations in context
- Provides single source of truth
- Components access via `useNewsContext()`
- Memoized handlers prevent re-renders

#### 4. UI Component Architecture

**NewsCard Trash Button**:
- **Position**: Third button in existing action group (after Heart, ExternalLink)
- **Icon**: `Trash2` from Lucide React (project standard)
- **Behavior**: Immediate deletion with toast feedback
- **No Modal**: Reduces friction, toast provides feedback
- **Styling**: `hover:text-destructive` for visual warning

**DeleteAllNewsDialog Component**:
- **Type**: Separate component using Radix UI Dialog
- **Trigger**: Outline button labeled "Delete All"
- **Content**: Detailed breakdown of what will be deleted
  - Total count
  - Breakdown by status (pending, reading, read)
  - Favorites count
  - Warning: "This action cannot be undone"
- **Actions**: Cancel (outline) + Delete All (destructive)
- **States**: Disabled when no items exist, loading during operation

**Placement**: Added to `NewsBoard` action button group (with Create, AI Generate)

#### 5. State Management Strategy

**Cache Invalidation**:
- **Approach**: Aggressive invalidation with `['news']` query key
- **Scope**: Invalidates all news-related queries (user news, stats, grouped data)
- **Why**: Ensures consistency, stats accuracy, proper Kanban board updates

**Loading States**:
- Individual delete: Button disabled, no spinner (quick operation)
- Bulk delete: Button text changes ("Delete All" → "Deleting...")
- Aggregated state: `deleteState.isLoading` combines both operations

**Error Handling**:
- Three-layer approach:
  1. API client catches network/response errors
  2. Mutations display toast notifications
  3. Context provides error to components
- Primary: Toast notifications (non-blocking)
- Secondary: Context error for custom handling

#### 6. Type Safety & Best Practices

**Schema Definition**:
```typescript
export interface DeleteAllNewsResponse {
  deleted_count: number;
  message: string;
}
```

**Service Types**:
- Explicit return types for clarity
- `Promise<void>` for 204 No Content responses
- Typed response objects for data-returning endpoints

**Mutation Hook Pattern**:
```typescript
return {
  action: mutation.mutate,      // Consistent naming
  isLoading: mutation.isPending, // V5 compatibility
  error: mutation.error,
  isSuccess: mutation.isSuccess,
};
```

#### 7. Accessibility Compliance

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- All buttons tabbable and focusable
- Dialog traps focus when open
- Escape key closes dialog

**Screen Readers**:
- Semantic button labels
- Dialog has proper title and description
- Destructive actions clearly indicated

**Visual Indicators**:
- Red hover state on trash buttons
- Destructive variant for confirm button
- Loading state prevents accidental clicks

### Critical Implementation Notes

**IMPORTANT - Avoid Common Mistakes:**

1. **React Query Version**: Project uses v5
   - Use `mutation.isPending` internally
   - Return as `isLoading` for consistency
   - Don't use deprecated `mutation.isLoading`

2. **API Client**: `delete` method already exists
   - Import from `@/core/data/apiClient`
   - Handles all errors centrally
   - Don't duplicate error handling

3. **Cache Invalidation**: Use broad approach
   - `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['news'] })`
   - Don't manually update cache
   - Let React Query refetch

4. **Toast Library**: Sonner configured
   - Import: `import { toast } from 'sonner';`
   - No setup needed
   - `toast.success()`, `toast.error()` available

5. **Dialog Component**: Radix UI configured
   - Import from `@/components/ui/dialog`
   - Accessibility built-in
   - No additional setup

6. **Theme Colors**: Use CSS variables
   - `--destructive` for delete actions
   - `bg-muted` for info boxes
   - `text-destructive` for warnings

### Potential UX Issues & Mitigations

**Issue 1: No Individual Delete Confirmation**
- **Decision**: Intentional design - reduces friction
- **Mitigation**: Toast provides immediate feedback
- **Future**: Could add undo functionality with soft delete

**Issue 2: Slow Bulk Deletion**
- **Current**: Button shows "Deleting..." text
- **Future**: Could add progress indicator for large datasets

**Issue 3: Race Conditions**
- **Mitigation**: All buttons disabled during `deleteState.isLoading`
- **Protection**: React Query ensures sequential processing

### Testing Best Practices Applied

#### 1. Mock Strategy
- **Module-level mocking**: Used `vi.mock()` at the top of test files
- **Service mocking**: Created reusable mock services in test utilities
- **Context mocking**: Mocked `useNewsContext` for component isolation
- **Toast mocking**: Mocked Sonner toast for notification verification

#### 2. Test Organization
- **Describe blocks**: Grouped related tests logically
- **Arrange-Act-Assert pattern**: Consistent structure throughout
- **Clear test names**: Descriptive names explaining what is tested

#### 3. Async Testing
- **waitFor**: Used for async operations
- **User event**: Used `userEvent.setup()` for realistic interactions
- **Loading state testing**: Verified intermediate states during operations

#### 4. Coverage Goals
- **Service layer**: 100% coverage of delete methods
- **Mutation hooks**: Comprehensive coverage of success/error/loading states
- **Component**: Full user interaction and accessibility coverage
- **Edge cases**: Extensive edge case testing (empty values, errors, race conditions)

### Test Execution

**Run all delete feature tests**:
```bash
npm test -- news.service.test
npm test -- useDeleteNews.mutation.test
npm test -- useDeleteAllNews.mutation.test
npm test -- DeleteAllNewsDialog.test
```

**Run with coverage**:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Key Testing Patterns

#### Service Tests Pattern
```typescript
describe('deleteNews', () => {
  it('should successfully delete a news item', async () => {
    // Arrange
    mockApiClient.delete.mockResolvedValue(undefined)

    // Act
    await newsService.deleteNews(newsId)

    // Assert
    expect(mockApiClient.delete).toHaveBeenCalledWith(`/api/news/${newsId}`)
  })
})
```

#### Mutation Hook Tests Pattern
```typescript
describe('useDeleteNewsMutation', () => {
  it('should show success toast on successful deletion', async () => {
    // Arrange
    mockNewsService.deleteNews.mockResolvedValue(undefined)
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useDeleteNewsMutation(), { wrapper })

    // Act
    result.current.deleteNews(newsId)

    // Assert
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(toast.success).toHaveBeenCalledWith('News item deleted successfully')
    })
  })
})
```

#### Component Tests Pattern
```typescript
describe('DeleteAllNewsDialog', () => {
  it('should call deleteAllNews when delete button is clicked', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const user = userEvent.setup()
    const mockDeleteAllNews = vi.fn()
    mockUseNewsContext.mockReturnValue({ deleteAllNews: mockDeleteAllNews })
    render(<DeleteAllNewsDialog />)

    // Act
    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /delete all/i }))
    const confirmButton = screen.getAllByRole('button', { name: /delete all/i })[1]
    await user.click(confirmButton)

    // Assert
    expect(mockDeleteAllNews).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  })
})
```

### Test Quality Indicators

6. ✅ Excellent cache invalidation strategy
7. ✅ Accessibility built-in (keyboard nav, focus management)

#### Issues Found

**🟡 Medium Priority (2 items)**:

1. **Missing ARIA Label on Individual Trash Button**
   - **File**: `frontend/src/features/news/components/NewsCard.tsx`
   - **Line**: 92-99
   - **Impact**: Screen reader users may not understand button purpose
   - **Fix**: Add `aria-label="Delete news item"` to button
   - **Estimated Time**: 5 minutes

2. **Individual Trash Button - No Loading State**
   - **File**: `frontend/src/features/news/components/NewsCard.tsx`
   - **Line**: 92-99
   - **Impact**: Users can rapidly click during delete operation
   - **Fix**: Add `disabled={deleteState.isLoading}` to button
   - **Estimated Time**: 10 minutes
   - **Note**: React Query prevents duplicate requests, but UX could be better

**🟢 Low Priority / Future Enhancements**:
1. Rate limiting for bulk delete operations (not critical for MVP)
2. Undo functionality with soft delete (UX enhancement)
3. Progress indicator for large datasets (500+ items)
4. Cross-tab synchronization (edge case)

#### Security Assessment
- ✅ Authentication enforced on all endpoints
- ✅ Authorization verified (user ownership)
- ✅ JWT token validation
- ✅ No client-side authorization bypass possible
- ✅ Input validation present
- ⚠️ Rate limiting recommended but not critical for MVP

#### Performance Assessment
- ✅ Individual delete: < 500ms (expected)
- ✅ Bulk delete (100 items): < 500ms (expected)
- ✅ Bulk delete (1000 items): < 2s (expected)
- ✅ Cache invalidation: < 50ms
- ✅ MongoDB indexes optimize queries
- ✅ Single query for bulk operations (no N+1)

#### Accessibility Assessment (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation: Complete
- ✅ Focus management: Correct (Radix UI)
- ✅ Color contrast: Meets standards
- ⚠️ ARIA labels: Missing on trash button
- ✅ Screen reader support: Good (with minor improvement)
- ✅ Focus visible: Yes
- **Overall**: Meets WCAG 2.1 AA with one minor fix
